A way to batch rename episode files en masse using python

Follow what the prompts say and there you have it
Options for naming scheme are as follows:

Name Episode #
Name Season # Episode #
Name E#
Name S#E#

If you don't want to figure out the total number of files you're using, just give an estimate to the nearest multiple of 10 as it determines how many 0s to add whether you have under 10 files, under 10 and between 100 files, between 100 and 1000 files, and then finally over 1000 files

other than that it's a pretty simple thing I made because I needed it, and I thought hey why not make it available for others to use 😎👍

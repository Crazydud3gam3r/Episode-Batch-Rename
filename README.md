Very simple, follow what the GUI says and you will be good to go

Options for naming scheme are as follows:

Name E# <br />
Name S#E# <br />

Meant for renaming media for use with applications(such as jellyfin, plex, ect) to detect it correctly

Other than that it's a pretty simple thing I made because I needed it, and I thought hey why not make it available for others to use 😎👍
